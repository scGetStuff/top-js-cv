The Odin Project, Full Stack JavaScript Path, JavaScript, React JS, Project: CV Application

- Not using CRA
- First pass just using one css.  Styled Components are covered later and I haven't done anything with SASS yet; so no CSS Modules Compiler


TODO:

- decide buttons, section or page
- submit should display a read only view.  maybe passed down a Read Only flag; make input conditionally render text vs par.  also disable submit button, enable edit
- Styled Components vs CSS Modules
