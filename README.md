# Notes
- Not using CRA
- CSS Modules; Styled Components are covered later in the course, so I'm using CSS Modules for my components.


# TODO:
- decide buttons - section or page
- submit should display a read only view.  maybe passed down a Read Only flag; make input conditionally render text vs par.  also disable submit button, enable edit
- look into https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html for global flag
